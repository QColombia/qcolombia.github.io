## Group's general description

QColombia is a group os scientists and students from the National university of Colombia. It focuses on the integration of physics, computing and engineering. The aim of the website is to summarize and showcase the group's efforts on three main directions

>1. Education and science communication
>1. Research and projects
>1. Events and/or meetings

### Education and science communication

The component of education and science communication mainly consists of two areas: formal courses and general interest communication. 

1. The **formal courses** are expected to be carried out as structured lessons, mainly as reading articles, like short books. 
1. General interest communication may be managed by a **blog**.

### Research and projects

Research and projects are mostly fundamental research, educational snipets of code and various other programming exercises carried out by the members of the team. This area may be divided in three items: Github, colaborations, academic production.

1. QColombia is expected to develop open source tools for educational and reserach purposes. Those are to be stored on **Github** repos.

1. QColombia is expected to collaborate with other groups in the STEM area of knowledge. All **collaborations** should be well documented and detailed.

1. Any **academic production** of the members of the team, in the context of the activites of the group, should be well referenced and documented.

### Events and meetings

QColombia is expected to lead the quantum revolution at National University of Colombia. This implies that science communication and education in the area is a fundamental component of the group. As a result, meetings, challenges, seminars, etc. are of key importance. They should be visible, well documented and of high quality content.

## Main layouts

The designated language for the website is _Spanish_. The site is expected to be composed of the following main layouts

- [ ] `default` (default template)
- [ ] `index` (home)
- [ ] `blog` (blog landing page)
- [ ] `post` (blog post)
- [ ] `cursos` (courses landing page)
- [ ] `curso` (course landing page)
- [ ] `colabs` (colabs landing page)
- [ ] `produccion` (academic production summary)
- [ ] `eventos` (events landing page)
- [ ] `evento` (event landing page)

These are the expected layouts of all the pages in the site. From these, all functionalities may be derived.

>It is expected that each event or colab is summarized on a _blog post_. Hence, the main view of each colab should redirect to thos posts. Events shouldhave an additional page for the event description.

**IMPORTANT:** This is a checklist in order to mark it all as the corresponding layout is created.
